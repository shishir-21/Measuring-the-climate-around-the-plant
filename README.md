# Plant Surrounding Monitoring System with raspberry pi4 

# Overview
This project aims to create a plant monitoring system capable of measuring temperature, humidity, moisture levels, and capturing images of plants. It provides a comprehensive solution for plant enthusiasts, researchers, or anyone interested in monitoring plant health remotely.

# Features
1. Temperature Monitoring: Measure ambient temperature to ensure optimal growing conditions for plants.
2. Humidity Monitoring: Monitor humidity levels to prevent over or under watering of plants.
3. Moisture Sensing: Measure soil moisture levels to ensure plants receive adequate water.
4. Image Capture: Capture images of plants for visual inspection and monitoring.
5. Share the data over the network with researchers using Syncthing (https://syncthing.net/).

# Hardware Requirements
1. Microcontroller (e.g., Raspberry Pi)
2. Temperature and Humidity Sensor (e.g., DHT11, DHT22)
3. Moisture Sensor (e.g., Soil Moisture Sensor)
4. Night Vision Camera Module (e.g., Raspberry Pi Camera Module)

# Software Requirements
1. Raspberry pi OS (https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
2. adafruit-circuitpython-dht
3. python3-rpi.gpio

# Installation
1. Connect the sensors and camera module to your microcontroller or Raspberry Pi following the provided schematics.
2. Upload the appropriate code to your Raspberry Pi.

# Usage
1. Power on the system and ensure all connections are properly set up.
2. Monitor the output of the system through run the Python script (for Raspberry Pi-based solutions).
3. View captured images and sensor data in real-time or access logged data for analysis.
