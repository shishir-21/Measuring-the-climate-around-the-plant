# Measuring the climate around the plant with raspberry pi4 

# Overview
This project aims to create a plant monitoring system capable of measuring temperature, humidity, moisture levels, and capturing images of plants. It provides a comprehensive solution for plant enthusiasts, researchers, or anyone interested in monitoring plant health remotely.

# Features
1 Temperature Monitoring: Measure ambient temperature to ensure optimal growing conditions for plants.
2 Humidity Monitoring: Monitor humidity levels to prevent over or under watering of plants.
3 Moisture Sensing: Measure soil moisture levels to ensure plants receive adequate water.
4 Image Capture: Capture images of plants for visual inspection and monitoring.
5 Share the data over network with researchers https://syncthing.net/.
